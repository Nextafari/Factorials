suppose you live in a city with the lights arranged in a perfect grid: you decide to go for a walk, at each intersection you
choose your next direction randomly
your four choices are NORTH, SOUTH, EAST or WEST, backtracking is permitted. Oncce you are finished with your walk 
you check to see how far you are away from the point you began. If you are more than 4 blocks away, you will pay for 
your transport back home, otherwise you will just walk.
what is the longest random walk you can make so that in average you will end up 4 blocks or fewer away from home?
